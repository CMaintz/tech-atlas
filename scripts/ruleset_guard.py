"""Does a change to a ratchet baseline LOOSEN it? Exit 1 = loosening (needs the
ruleset-change label), 0 = safe.

Per-entry, not aggregate: any entry ADDED or INCREASED is a loosening; removals
are fine. This is what defeats the offset attack — fixing one violation while
suppressing another nets zero on a summed count, but shows up here as an added
entry.

Canonical copy. Onboarded repos commit this at scripts/ruleset_guard.py so both
the inline gate and foundry's reusable tier0.yml (which runs in the caller's
checkout) can call it.

Kinds:
  eslint  eslint-suppressions.json      (per file+rule count)
  snooze  habit-hooks snooze.json, and dependency-cruiser known-violations JSON
          (position-independent multiset of scalar leaves — an added violation
          increments its scalars, so it's caught; reorder/remove are safe)
  lines   ArchUnit FreezingArchRule store files (one frozen violation per line;
          run once per changed store file under archunit_store/)
  coverage  prompt-eval manifest.json — INVERSE: a REMOVED fixture is less coverage,
            so removal (not addition) is the loosening

Usage: ruleset_guard.py <eslint|snooze|lines|coverage> <base-ref> <head-ref> <path>
