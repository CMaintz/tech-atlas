"""Does a change to a ratchet baseline LOOSEN it? Exit 1 = loosening (needs the
ruleset-change label), 0 = safe.

Per-entry, not aggregate: any entry ADDED or INCREASED is a loosening; removals
are fine. This is what defeats the offset attack - fixing one violation while
suppressing another nets zero on a summed count, but shows up here as an added
entry.

Canonical copy. Onboarded repos commit this at scripts/ruleset_guard.py so both
the inline gate and foundry's reusable tier0.yml (which runs in the caller's
checkout) can call it.

Kinds:
  eslint  eslint-suppressions.json      (per file+rule count)
  snooze  habit-hooks snooze.json, and dependency-cruiser known-violations JSON
          (position-independent multiset of scalar leaves - an added violation
          increments its scalars, so it's caught; reorder/remove are safe)
  lines   ArchUnit FreezingArchRule store files (one frozen violation per line;
          run once per changed store file under archunit_store/)
  coverage  prompt-eval manifest.json - INVERSE: a REMOVED fixture is less coverage,
            so removal (not addition) is the loosening
  inline  IN-SOURCE suppression directives, test-skips and config demotions, counted
          tree-wide per (file, directive) at both refs - an added eslint-disable /
          @ts-ignore / @SuppressWarnings / # noqa / #pragma warning disable /
          coverage-exclusion / it.skip / editorconfig severity=none is a loosening the
          baseline files above never see. No <path>: the base tree IS the baseline. Same
          per-entry shrink-only property as eslint, so the offset attack is still caught.
  tests   TEST DELETION: test-definition count PER FILE, INVERSE - a file with fewer
          tests at head than base lost coverage (deleted or moved out). No <path>.

Usage: ruleset_guard.py <eslint|snooze|lines|coverage> <base-ref> <head-ref> <path>
       ruleset_guard.py <inline|tests> <base-ref> <head-ref>
